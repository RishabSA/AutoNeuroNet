![AutoNeuroNet logo](assets/autoneuronet_name.svg)

AutoNeuroNet is a fully implemented automatic differentiation engine with custom matrices, a full neural network architecture, and a training pipeline. It comes with Python bindings via PyBind11, enabling quick, easy network development in Python, backed by C++ for enhanced speed and performance.

**Who this is for you if:**

- You want a small, inspectable autodiff engine with C++-backed performance
- You want a controllable experience and wnat to learn how automatic differentiation and neural networks work under the hood
- You want to try out a new deep learning package

**Next steps**

- Install the package: see [`Install`](install.md).
- Run a first example: see [`Quickstart`](quickstart.md).
- Browse full API: see [`API`](api.md).
